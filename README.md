# Overview
This is a classwork example in which "I plan to open an ice cream and surf shop in Hawaii ". The investor has requested temperature information for the island that will eventually be home to the ice cream and surf shop. Using SQLAlchemy to connect to and query a SQLite database (hawaii.sqlite), I will present temperature information using graphs and a Flask API script. 

## Purpose
I am providing a summary of temperature information to my investor to prove that my choice of location would allow customer demand to be consistent. By request, I will present results specifically from June and December.
